# [IPPT Calculator](https://ippt.davidcjw.com)

A modern web app to calculate your Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) score for Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Home Team, and related organizations.

## What is IPPT?

The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) is Singapore's national fitness test for servicemen and servicewomen. It consists of three stations:
- **Push-Ups** (maximum reps in 1 minute)
- **Sit-Ups** (maximum reps in 1 minute)
- **2.4km Run** (timed)

Scores are awarded for each station based on age group and gender, and the total score determines your award tier (Fail, Pass, Silver, Gold) and monetary incentives.

## About This App

This app allows you to:
- Select your gender and age group
- Adjust your push-up, sit-up, and 2.4km run performance using sliders
- Instantly see your score for each station, total score, and the corresponding award/incentive
- Explore how many more reps or how much faster you need to improve your score

All scoring is based on the latest official IPPT tables for 2025.
